            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>neſs being to Explain the Offices, I would rather meddle with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51432:3"/> Matter of Fact, nor diſpute with any Party: Only I muſt clear the way to our grateful Obſervation of this Day, by proving very briefly, the reality of the <hi>Gun-powder Plot,</hi> which ſome Romaniſts are ſo hardy as to deny; and by ſhewing this latter Deliverance was alſo a mighty Bleſſing, which ſome prejudiced Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſeem unwilling to grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Papiſts did really deſign to blow up King <hi>James,</hi> with the Prince and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by Gunpowder on this Day, is not only evident in general, by their former Plots and practices in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and their endeavours to hinder King <hi>James</hi> his Succeſſion to the Crown<note n="(f)" place="margin">See the Preface to Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi>'s Hiſtory.</note>: But it appears more particularly, 1ſt, By the Materials found in that Infernal Vault, and the ſeizing a deſperate Papiſt with the Keys in his hands, late in the Night, before the intended Maſſacre. 2ly, By the Flight and open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the other chief Conſpirators upon the Diſcovery. 3ly, By the Confeſſions under the hands of <hi>Fawks</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> two principal Agents in this horrid Plot. 4ly, By the Trials of all the Criminals, yet extant at large; ſhewing the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Evidence and judicial Proofs by which they were convicted. 5ly, By Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial of the Jeſuits, his owning his knowledge of this Deſign by a Declaration made before his Execution. 6ly, By the Letters of Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> a Perſon equally eminent for his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and his Zeal for <hi>Rome,</hi> who acknowledges he knew of and approved this Plot. 7ly, By the Romaniſts abroad, crying them all up for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51432:4"/> Martyrs, who died in this Cauſe, as intending to ſerve their Church. <hi>Lastly,</hi> By the Laws made here in full Parliament with mature deliberation, upon this occaſion. And thoſe who can deny this Evidence, may outface the plaineſt Truth.</p>
               <p>As to the Second Deliverance, it is too freſh, and was too publick to be downright denyed as yet; but ſome endeavour to leſſen our Senſe of it, and Gratitude for it, by privately ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting, 1st, That we were in no danger of Popery. 2ly, That it was only a pretence to remove one Prince and ſet up another. 3ly, That we are in as ill Circumſtances now, as we were before. I would not mention theſe Objections, but that (how improbable ſoever they are) ſome venture to aſſert them, and others are ſo credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to believe them, and thereby guard their Ingratitude for this late Mercy; which I think they ought to praiſe God for, if they will impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conſider what is candidly offered to confute theſe Inſinuations.</p>
               <p>For our great Danger of Popery under the late King appears,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the great encouragement given to that Religion: And here we may conſider the Kings temper and zeal for it: The numbers of Prieſts and Jeſuits, and their eagerneſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it: The great Army kept up in times of Peace, and the care to model it with Officers that would ſupport Arbitrary Power: The libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rewards offered and given for turning to that Church: The open profeſſion of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in defiance to all Laws unrepealed that did prohibit it: The Arts uſed to procure a pre-engaged Parliament, to make way for it by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51432:4"/> repealing the Teſt and Penal Laws: The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Men unqualified, Papiſts or their Friends, into all ſorts of Offices and Preferments, Civil, Military and Eccleſiaſtical: The Contrivance to have an Heir in a lucky Hour, to give them another Reign to bring this about, if the firſt ſhould too ſoon expire: The open Boaſts of the Romaniſts themſelves, who beſt knew that Prince's Mind; and finally, The vaſt number of Atheiſts, Diſſenters and pretended Proteſtants, who came in as Tools to carry on this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Theſe Conſiderations ſhew, that Popery was intended to be ſet up; and it is as plain, that Proteſtant Religion was intended to be pulled down, by the violent proceedings againſt Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; the altering their Magiſtrates and ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Charters; by the diſgracing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing all the ſteddy Profeſſors of it out of their Offices in the Court and Camp, on the Benches above, and in the Country alſo; by ejecting a whole Society, and many private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of their Freeholds in the Univerſities, and elſewhere, without Law; by Impriſoning the Biſhops for an humble Petition; by ſetting up an illegal Court with an unlimited Power over all the Clergy, and drawing all of them that were firm to the Proteſtant Religion, into the danger of a Suſpenſion. This I hope may ſatisfie diſintereſted Men, that our peril was as great as it was real and imminent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the preſent King did intend to put a ſtop to the Dangers we were in, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. But that he did not deſign either the Removal of the late King, or his own Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Throne, is manifeſt, 1st, By the ſmall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51432:5"/> number he brought with him, fit only to guard him during a Treaty, not to exclude a Prince who had treble his Forces in Arms. 2ly, By his ſlow proceedings, his offering and entring on a Treaty, and deſiring to refer all to a Parliament. 3ly, By the firſt ſecret and voluntary Flight of the late King, after his Army was Disbanded; neither of which was foreſeen by the Prince. 4ly, By his gentle Uſage of the late King, when he was in his Power, and offering to renew the Treaty. 5ly, By his Declaration, that he came with no deſign to take the Crown: And his known In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity (for which he is celebrated over <hi>Europe</hi>) gives great weight to this. 6ly, So doth alſo the Conformity of his Actions to this Proteſtation; for he medled not with the Government till the Archbiſhop, the Nobility and ſome Biſhops, and very Great Men preſſed the Adminiſtration upon him: Nor would he accept the Crown, till it was given him and his Queen by a full and free Convention. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> By the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that he hath no Advantage by the Change; he had no Children to ſucceed him; he entred upon an expenſive and hazardous Deſign; his Fortune had more plenty and more eaſe in his former ſtation, and (abating his ſatisfaction in delivering us) he gets nothing but trouble and danger by this Title. So that if our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances had not made his Advancement to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, he had no reaſon to deſire it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Romaniſts ſay, <hi>Their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are no better now;</hi> we grant it: But it is ſurprizing that Engliſh Proteſtants ſhould ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt this. For, 1ſt, as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> Have we no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the preſerving our Monarchy on its ancient
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51432:5"/> Baſis, and keeping up the Laws for our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Properties? Are not Charters reſtored, Parliaments brought back to their old meaſures of free Elections, and regular Proceedings? Are not all Judges, Magiſtrates and Officers qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by Law, and left free to act according to Law? Are we in danger of any ſtretches of the Prerogative now; and is not the mildneſs of our Adminiſtration become almoſt a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance? If the Taxes be objected, we muſt conſider that it was thoſe who aggrandized the French to this degree, made them neceſſary: That the preſent King hath no benefit at all by them, not ſo much as a Salary for his Hazard, Toil and Care; and that if they attain the End, a Peace will ſoon repay us with large Intereſt. 2ly, If we be Proteſtants of the Church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, is it no benefit to have a King declaring himſelf of that Religion? To have our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and all God's Ordinances in the Primitive way? To have our Biſhops and Regular Clergy encouraged and protected, and Learning and Piety as much promoted as ever? 3ly, If we be Diſſenters purely for Conſcience ſake, and do not aim at Dominion; is it no favour to be freed from Penalties, and at liberty to worſhip in our own Way? How did theſe, addreſs, ſubmit and comply in the late Reign, for a precarious Liberty, intended to introduce Popery; and is a legal Freedom, deſigned to keep out Popery by uniting Proteſtants, worth nothing?

Let us, who are Members of this Reformed Church, give humble Praiſes to our God, as well for the Fountain as for the Streams; for his gracious Nature, and never ceaſing Mercy, which inclines him in all Ages to do us good: And for the real effects of theſe Inclinations, his reſcuing us from Popery at firſt, and his frequent delivering us ſince, out of the hands of thoſe our cruel Foes.</p>

And though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of an excellent Religion be a mighty bleſſing, it is ſo only to thoſe who live up to the Principles of it, and walk by its Rules; theſe only are better by it in this world, and theſe alone ſhall be ſaved by it in the next world: What ſignifies the freedom to profeſs the true Faith to him that lives like an Infidel<note n="(z)" place="margin">Inter Chriſtianum &amp; Gentilem non fides tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm debet, ſed vit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

His Religion is worſe by the ſcandal he brings on it, and he will be no better by all the pretences he makes to it: If Popery had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, ſuch men could not either have lived more wickedly, or periſhed more certainly: Wherefore that the preſerving and eſtabliſhing our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may be a real Bleſſing to us, here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; let us repent and carefully avoid ſecurity, negligence and preſumption; and this is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative part: And let the continuance of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, by ſuch ſignal Providences, move us to be more diligent and zealous; both in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it in that pure way of Worſhip it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and in adorning it with ſuch holy lives as it directs us to lead; and this is the affirmative part, of which the next Paragraph gives us the particulars.</p>

For God's Firſt Favours are generally given freely without any reaſon in us; but his Second are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only becauſe he had been kind before<note n="(r)" place="margin">Math.

For, Firſt, By this Means our King will be kept in the true Religion; and a late inſtance hath taught us how ſad a Judgment it is for a Reformed Nation to have their King pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Roman Faith. If we can remember what we feared and felt then, we cannot but pray we may never ſee the like caſe again in <hi>England,</hi> where that Religion is ſo odious, that if a King profeſs it, and attempt to eſtabliſh it, the fatal conſequence muſt be his own or his peoples ruin. Secondly. As theſe Kingdoms are now generally Proteſtant, we pray that we may be preſerved and protected in that Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is the ſame that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and all Orthodox Primitive Fathers taught, agreeable to our civil Conſtitution, and the certain way to make us and our Poſterity happy both here and hereafter. Whereas the Roman Doctrine is Corrupt, their Worſhip Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, their Government a heavy Yoke, that neither our Fathers were<note n="(f)" place="margin">Vid.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51432:28"/> mighty Bleſſing both to Prince and People. And Finally, We own that every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will have great advantage thereby; for then we may all duly ſerve God, we may freely and without interruption come to his Houſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his Ordinances, which are Purely and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively adminiſtred there. Yea, and this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Bleſſing being continued, our comfort in that Providence which preſerves this Holy Religion, will oblige us continually to render Publick Thanks and Praiſe to him that doth preſerve and continue it, <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p n="11">§. 11. <hi>ETernal God, and our moſt mighty Protector, &amp;c.]</hi> On this Prayer we may be the briefer, ſince we have inlarged on both the Deliverances here commemorated before. We might juſtly be diſcouraged, conſidering how many Years our Enemies have by reſtleſs Endeavours, and variety of Deſigns laboured to extirpate Our Religion and ſet up Theirs: But we remember our God lives for ever, he is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, he ever was, is, and will be able to defeat them, and ſave us<note n="(g)" place="margin">Omnia quae mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, deſinunt eſſe quod erant, &amp; incipiunt eſſe quod non erant: Eſſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum non habet niſi qui non mutatur. <hi>D. Aug. in Exod. III. 13.</hi>
                  </note>. Let them by their Intereſt abroad, and Inſinuations at home, draw in never ſo many to aſſiſt them, our Protector is mightier than their United Force; and we hope he will employ his Eternal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power for our Defence, becauſe we are his Servants, believing as he hath taught, and worſhiping as he hath directed us in his Holy Word. 'Tis true, we are very unworthy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſo good a Maſter, too apt to offend him by our diſobedience, and to diſoblige him by our ingratitude and diſtruſt. But ſince he is pleaſed to be favourable to us ſtill, in a deep ſenſe of his goodneſs and our unworthineſs, we do this Day come to his Houſe, and on our bended Knees acknowledge both our Deliverances. We declare, that three of his glorious Attributes were very viſible in the former: His Power in breaking that horrid Deſign; his Wiſdom in letting it run
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51432:29"/> on almoſt to the laſt Minute, till the Principal Actor was taken ſo prepared for the Fact, that it could not be denied: And Finally, His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſaving ſo many eminent and innocent Perſons from the ſuddeneſt and horrideſt Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that ever was invented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make us, we beſeech thee, truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for this, &amp;c.]</hi> Perhaps ſome may think our Forefathers were, but we are not obliged to give Thanks for this Mercy: But let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, if this Plot had ſucceeded, our Nation had been ſubjected to a foreign Power, and our Religion extirpated here; ſo that we had ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Slavery and Popery with our Mothers Milk. We owe the Liberty that we now enjoy, and the Faith we at this day profeſs, to the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Prevention of this dreadful Plot; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as long as this Church and Government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, we muſt be thankful throughout all Ages upon this happy Day; eſpecially ſince God hath now refreſhed our Memories by another Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the ſame ſort of Enemies, upon the very ſame Day: If our Anceſtors only had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived evidences of his infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, we might have had ſome excuſe; but when we needed the aſſiſtance of the ſame Attributes, they were exerted again for our reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue: Let us therefore heartily praiſe his Holy Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We bleſs thee for giving his Majeſty that now is, &amp;c.]</hi> This is a grateful owning the Means of our Second Deliverance, which was his preſent Majeſty's Arrival; he loved our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, pitied to ſee us and it like to be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; was nearly concerned (by his Title to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51432:30"/> Succeſſion) to keep all right here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generouſly ventured his Life and Fortune to reſcue us. Our Enemies hoped the Waves would have ſwallowed him, and a bare rumour of that made them cry high and violent as ever, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us it was not love to us, but fear of him that made them ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt<note n="(h)" place="margin">Quae quia non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, non facit illa facit. <hi>Ovid. am. l. 3. cl. 4.</hi>
                  </note>. But Heaven ſet him ſafe on ſhoar, and then their next Reſolve was to expel him again by Force; but no conſidering Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants could be found willing to deſtroy their Deliverer, nor to fight againſt their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Liberties; and thus all oppoſition fell before him, and that unhappy Prince who had deſerted the God of his Father, was deſerted by his Army, and then ſecretly deſerted the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leaving us no other Choice, but to remain in Anarchy, to ſtay till he ſhould return with foreign Force: Or to put the next undoubted Heir with her Conſort our Deliverer (a near Branch of the ſame Royal Houſe) into the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Throne. And the laſt expedient was pitcht upon as the only means of our ſafety, by the unanimous conſent of the far greateſt part of the Kingdom: Wherefore thoſe who truly love their Religion and their Civil Rights, do juſtly rejoyce that there is ſo powerful and faithful a Friend to both, by ſo ſignal a Providence now reigning over us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Continue we beſeech thee, to protect and defend him, &amp;c.]</hi> As we believe this Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was conducted by Providence, we have juſt cauſe to pray with holy <hi>David, That God would

Finally, when they had made themſelves ſtrong enough to appear Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and weakned the King ſo far that they hoped to conquer him, they turned Open Rebels, ſeize his Towns and Forts, baniſh him from his Houſe, bring an Army into the Field, purſue his Loyal Subjects with Fire and Sword, and in many bloody Battels (in which he was preſent) ſought his deſtruction; yet ſtill gave it out, they <hi>fought for the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</hi> But as ſoon as our Sins and ſome of his Treacherous Subjects had put him into their hands, they would not ſpare him, nor let him eſcape; (as his Son did ſince, though he had really attempted that which was but pretended againſt the Father:) But they injuſtly Impriſoned him, and falſly charging him with the Murders and Oppreſſion which they had cauſed, they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him without Law, and executed him without Mercy: And then altered the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they had ſworn to defend, changed the Laws which they had promiſed to guard, and utterly deſtroyed the Church which they had Covenanted to reform. And having made themſelves our Rulers, impiouſly and ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly invaded the Revenues of the Crown and Miter; plundered and oppreſſed, impriſoned and murdered all that had oppoſed this New-invented Uſurpation: And, finally, they left the People no ſhadow of Liberty, and broke Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into ſo many petty and ridiculous Sects, that we were the ſcorn of Atheiſts and Papiſts,

The whole proceeding was indeed very ſtrange; the rabble and drags of the People mutinyed, and the Great Men (whom he had advanced) met in Cabals, and conſulted how to pull down the true Religion, which the Lord had planted here<note n="(h)" place="margin">Acts IX. 4. — <hi>me</hi> (inquit Chriſtus) <hi>non meos.</hi> Aug. de ſanct Serm. 14.</note>, and to deſtroy Gods Anointed, who they know would not permit

For the compaſſing of which bloody Deſign, they repreſented all his Actions moſt falſly and maliciouſly in their Libels, Speeches and Remonſtrances, and then raiſed open War againſt Him without any juſt Cauſe: For he had not attempted either to alter Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or invade Property, as they falſly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.</p>

So did alſo the ſpiteful Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they made on his Sufferings, as if they were a demonſtration of Gods having rejected and deſerted him.

Thoſe Foes of this Church and Nation, who had murdered our King and oppreſſed us, were ſuddenly routed, without our ſtriking one ſtroak: One angry Look of thine diſſipated and deſtroyed them<note n="(y)" place="margin">Veni, vidi, vici; <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> Julii Caeſ. <hi>Suet.</hi>

There was at the Reſtauration an eminent Example of this here, and therefore I muſt exhort all the Members of this our <hi>Zion</hi> to praiſe the Lord, and to publiſh with joy what he did for us.

There is always ſome Mercy mixt with his Juſtice; and to make that appear the brighter, we introduce our Praiſes, with a proſpect of the black ſide of this dreadful Tragedy, which was made up of ſo many horrid Crimes and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Miſeries, that one would ſcarce imagine ſuch a Lyon could yeild any ſweetneſs.

            <p>THAT which was premiſed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Office, may ſerve for a Preface to this, becauſe the Miſeries of that Day made way for the Joy of this Solemnity. The Royal Martyrs Cruel Tragedy, and all the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

To ſee our Oppreſſors ſuddenly vaniſh, our Ancient Government, and our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, our Native Liberties and Gods True Religion reſtored without Blood, or the leaſt Oppoſition, was the wonder of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World; and ſo great a Bleſſing to this Land, that ſo long as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that Royal Family then reſtored, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue (which I hope will be till Time be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by Eternity;) ſo long this Day muſt be regiſtred in our Kalenders, as a day of Praiſe and Thankſgiving.

Our Religion, our Liberty, our Eſtates and Lives were all at Stake; yea, we and our Hopes alſo ſeemed to be buried in the Earth: Yet according to thy wonted Compaſſion, thou didſt turn and refreſh us with an unexpected Deliverance.

May it be our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make the Memory of this Deliverance to endure longer than our Lives, by acquainting our Children what Honour God acquired by his Juſtice on our Foes, and his Mercy on us and our injured Prince, on this Occaſion.

Let the Prieſts excite the People, and let them ſtir up one another this Day to go to the Publick Aſſembly, and there to rejoice and give Thanks, not only outwardly and with their Lips, but inwardly and ſincerely from the bottom of the Heart. Nor is one Day ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this Duty, the Lord deſerves daily Praiſes, for there is not a day when we are in Trouble, that he doth not help us, not an hour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth not pour his Benefits on us ſo liberally, as to load us with his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="(i)" place="margin">Who daily loadeth us with Benefits <hi>New Tranſlation, ver.</hi> 19.</note>.</p>

WHen the Cities of <hi>Judah</hi> had been deſtroyed, their Temple burn, true Religion baniſhed, and the Profeſſors of it had long been made Slaves and Captives; God was pleaſed ſo ſuddenly to turn their Affairs, and reſtore their Government, Liberties and Religion, that thoſe Pious, but long oppreſſed Jews, who lived to ſee that joyful Day, could ſcarce be perſuaded the thing was real; the Happineſs was too big for their Faith<note n="(l)" place="margin">Gaudium tam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperatum, ut vix credibilo erat. <hi>Ab.

                  </note>. And like the conquered <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who expected nothing leſs than Slavery, (hearing the Roman Praetor proclaim their Freedom) they were apt to fancy it was only ſome pleaſant Dream, or waking Deluſion of their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="(m)" place="margin">— illi vero mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabundi ſomni ſpeciem arbitrabantur. <hi>Livius.</hi>

But ſo ſoon as they and we recovered our Selves, and found our Deliverance was real, the reſtoring of our Religion and Liberties was celebrated with all imaginable demonſtrations of Joy; our Looks were ſprightly and cheerful, and we univerſally expreſſed our inward ſatisfaction, by juſt and loud Praiſes to our Deliverer.</p>

Whoſe kindneſs to us in this auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Change was ſo remarkable, that all our Neighbour Nations took notice how ſuddenly and wonderfully our God had changed the Face of our Affairs; ſo that from Exiles and Bondmen, we were become perfectly Free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> IV. But while they only wondred at this, it becomes us to own that it was the hand of God alone that brought it about for our good, and to rejoyce exceedingly for the mighty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours we have already received, ſo far beyond our Deſerts.</p>

And becauſe there ſtill remains ſome bitter Roots of thoſe old ſeditious Principles and factious Opinions then ſowed among us, We will pray, that this Example may root them out, and make us all truly Loyal to our King, and unanimouſly Conformable to the Church eſtabliſhed. O that the evil ſucceſs of open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and endleſs Schiſms, might bring in a Flood of Converts, from among our decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Brethren; this would make both Church and State quiet and fruitful, and like <hi>Egypt</hi> (when the Sun hath melted the Snow and Ice in the Head of <hi>Nilus</hi>

We had undergon variety of Changes, and tried every way but the right to ſettle us again, <hi>Lords and Commons, Commons alone, Keepers of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, a Lord General, a Protector, a Committee of Safety, and a Supream Military Government,</hi> which ended in plain Anarchy. In the Church varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sects and Factions, but nothing eſtabliſhed; the Order of the Clergy laid in Common, the Articles of Faith, Rites of Worſhip, and Rules of Diſcipline utterly broken to pieces, and all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion left Arbitrary to every puiſny Party, yea to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51432:103"/> every whimſical Man, till there was not ſo much as the Face of Unity or Order left among us. Now to reſcue us out of this Chaos, and reſtore both Church and State of a ſudden to their priſtine Splendor, was really a moſt miraculous Providence.</p>

                  <hi>By reſtoring to us, and to his own juſt and undoubted, &amp;c.]</hi> From the conſideration of the Author of our Deliverance, and the Evils we were freed from, we regularly paſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the means by which this was effected, which was the reſtoring our late gracious King, <hi>Charles</hi> II. to his People, and to his rightful Throne: They had Murdered his Father upon falſe Pretences, but his Son and undoubted Heir had done nothing that ſeemed to forfeit his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; nothing but open Violence and unjuſt Force excluded him<note n="(f)" place="margin">

Which at laſt of it ſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Hearts of the whole Nation; ſo that without any oppoſition, his Enemies fell before him, and he was reſtored again, to the joy of the whole Nation, who had been ſo long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the very Dregs of their own Fellow-ſubjects, that they expreſſed an univerſal ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to ſee their own King, the Defender of the True Faith, once more ſet over Gods Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſtoring alſo unto us the publick and free profeſſion, &amp;c.]</hi> As much as Eternity exceeds Time, and the Soul excels the Body; ſo much (if poſſible) ſhould our Joy for Spiritual Good Things ſurpaſs that which reſpects our Temporal Advantages; and doubtleſs that was the greateſt Cauſe of all Pious Mens rejoycing at the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; that together with the rightful King, the publick and free Profeſſion of the right Religion was alſo reſtored. 'Twas <hi>Julian</hi>'s policy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Jews, and all ſorts of Hereticks to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their ſeveral Religions, and prohibit only the Orthodox Chriſtians; and our Oppreſſors imitated him, for they Tolerated the vileſt Sects, the falſeſt Opinions, and the abſurdeſt ways of Worſhip; nothing was Penal, nothing Forbid and Perſecuted, but the old eſtabliſhed Religion of this Church: So that, for many years, ſome thouſands of the beſt Chriſtians could not joyn in the Publick Worſhip of God, nor had they any regular Offices or Sacraments, but what they could enjoy in private, from Perſons ſilenced and deprived of all means of ſubſiſtence. Now it was ſo happy and ſo comfortable a Change to theſe, to have the true Articles of Faith, and Ancient ways of Worſhip reſtored, with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, the Liturgy, and the holy Sacraments, that nothing was ſo pleaſing to their Souls as this. The end for which Kings are advanced is, <hi>to be Miniſters of God to their People for good</hi>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> XIII. 4.</note>. Now the chiefeſt good that Chriſtian People can have from a Prince is, his protecting the True Religion, his being a

A juſt King is a great Bleſſing, but if he profeſs and defend the True Religion alſo, that makes him a double Bleſſing; for then he fully anſwers the end of his Advancement to God, and comes up to whatever good Subjects can deſire. Now this being our Caſe at the Reſtauration, there was great reaſon for pious Men to expreſs an extraordinary ſatisfaction; yea, thoſe who had no concern for Religion (or however for that eſtabliſhed) had temporal grounds to rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the State as well as the Church was reſtored to its former Peace and Proſperity: Every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man regained his juſt Rights; the Prince was content to govern by Law, and the Subjects were protected from Injuries at home and abroad; Trade flouriſhed, Plenty every where abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there was a happy Peace given us to improve and enjoy all theſe Bleſſings<note n="(i)" place="margin">Dulce nomen eſt Pacis, res verò ipſa ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda tum ſalutaris. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.

Secondly, We are to offer up the Praiſes of our Lips unto him in Hymns and Pſalms, that we may declare the glory of his great Name, and let all men ſee his Mercy endureth for ever; he is the ſame gracious God, who in all Ages did deliver and preſerve his Church and People; and our joyful praiſing him for this new inſtance of his Favour, will invite others to love and truſt in him; yea, it will engage many to joyn with us in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring and glorifying his holy Name: But, Thirdly, There is another offering required, <hi>viz. the ſincere oblation of our ſelves to the ſervice of our Deliverer</hi>

Now if we apply this to God, he did thus ſave and deliver us in theſe Nations, and we can no other way own our Lives and Liberties to be his Gifts, but by intirely giving up our ſelves to do his holy Will all the days of our Lives: And though, conſidering our vileneſs, and the imperfect Services which we do him, when we do our beſt, this is but a mean and unworthy Offering, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants<note n="(o)" place="margin">

The Actors in the Popiſh Treaſon and this, pretended to be as different in their Principles as they were in their Methods, but their Ends were one and the ſame, which was to ruin the Eſtabliſhed Government and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and though their ſucceſs was different for a while, yet the ſame Gracious God, who had prevented the firſt, blaſted alſo the later De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. So that it is proper enough in general to make the ſame Acknowledgments on both Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But as to that which relates to this Day, we may note, 1. The Efficient Cauſe of this ſingnal and wonderful Deliverance, which was, <hi>the allwiſe and good Providence of God,</hi> whoſe Wiſdom baffled their Policies, and whoſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs moved him to Pity the injured King, and the oppreſſed People of this Land; and as on this Day he reſcued both in ſo ſtrange a manner, as exceeded any thing that the Uſurpers could fear, or the Sufferers hope for. For ſo great, ſo ſudden and ſo peaceable a Change never was wrought in any Nation in the World before; it was the viſible hand of God that did effect it. Secondly, The Objects of this Favour were, our late Gracious Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> II. with the whole Royal Family, who returned this
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51432:108"/> Day from that tedious twelve Years Exile, into which their Enemies Malice had driven them, and in which their Power had till then detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: But the Mercy was not confined to them, all Orders and Degrees of Men in Church and State ſhared with them in this Bleſſing: The Nobility and Gentry had been trampled on and impoveriſhed; the Orthodox Clergy ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and ſilenced; the Commons overburdned with Taxes and Freequarter, and all but the Uſurpers and their Myrmidons ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; but with the King and his Family, all theſe were reſtored to their Priviledges, Honours, Offices and Eſtates. And Thirdly, it ſhould add to our joy, to conſider what the Nation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from, that is, from an unnatural Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein Subjects were engaged againſt a moſt religious King, the Father of his Country, and Natural Fathers againſt their Sons, Brother againſt Brother, and Relations obliged to kill their neareſt Friends<note n="(b)" place="margin">Non victoria eſt iſta, quae à Civibus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portatur, ferro quo ipſos necas, teipſum confodis. <hi>Job Ludolf. hiſtor.

                  </note>. So that which ſide ſoever gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Nation was ſure to loſe. Again, We were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that Uſurpation and Tyranny, which the pretended Saints, but really impious Conquerors, had got by Force, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with Cruelty over their Fellow-ſubjects. Finally, We were delivered from all ſorts of Confuſions in Church and State, and the woful Ruin to private Families and Perſons conſequent thereupon. For all this to end in Peace and Tranquility, and every ones regaining his own

               <head>A Practical Diſcourſe on this Collect.</head>
               <p n="12">§. 12. <hi>ALmighty God, and Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who of, &amp;c.]</hi> This Regular Collect (as the Analyſis ſhews) contains all that is proper on this Occaſion, and rightly begins with a Confeſſion, that the Author of this great Work was Almighty God our Heavenly Father. Nothing leſs than Omnipotence could, and none but a Coeleſtial Father would bring ſuch mighty things to paſs<note n="(i)" place="margin">— Deus nobis haec otia fecit. <hi>Virg.</hi>
                  </note>. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our Enemies Power, and our inability to reſiſt, it was Infinite Mercy to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and required an Almighty Arm to reſcue us: And the way by which it was effected was ſo wonderful and extraordinary, that it ſcarce can be parallel'd in Hiſtory. That ſuch as had ſeized the ſupreme Power, and were guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a mighty Fleet, and a ſtrong Army, ſecured by all the Forts and Magazines, by Friends, and by all the Wealth in the Nation, ſhould of a ſudden, without one ſtroke, either fly from, or ſubmit to a poor Prince, whom they had ſtript of all but his Innocence, and his Right; and that alone Sunk them, and Exalted him. Again, The Collect calls to our Minds the Temper of thoſe we were then delivered from, being ſuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes ſhould come in the laſt and worſt of Times<note n="(k)" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> III. 4.</note>, <hi>Traitors to the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51432:114"/> beſt of Kings,</hi> Heady and Obſtinate in their evil Deſigns, High-minded and Impatient of any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior. Now nothing but the Ruin of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country can ſatisfie ſuch Mens Avarice and Ambition; and ſince that is too odious to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, they covered the Bloody Hook with a pretended Zeal for a pure Religion, and a through Reformation both in Church and State, and a feigned Reverence for God's Name; which were ſuch taking Baits to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, who thought them all Saints<note n="(l)" place="margin">Duplicis peccati re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus eſt, non habere quod creditur, &amp; quod non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo ſimulare. <hi>Sulpic. Sever. ep. ad Soror.</hi>
                  </note>, that thereby they pulled down the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and broke the Church to pieces, enriching themſelves with all the ill-gotten Spoils of both Crown and Miter. Yea, they had by this holy Cheat proceeded ſo far towards the Nations utter Ruin, that ſome People thought we were more likely to fall a miſerable Prey to ſome Foreign Tyrant, than ever to be reſtored to our own King, our Religion and our Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And we do this Day moſt heartily and devoutly adore, &amp;c.]</hi> The goodneſs of our God in preventing ſo dreadful and ſo near a Miſchief, deſerves more Praiſes than we can poſſibly give. We ſhould be the moſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all Men, if we did not upon this Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Day of our Stupendious Deliverance, annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pay this juſt Tribute of Thankſgiving, with ſincere Gratitude and ſervent Devotion. Our God magnified his Name by this Miracle of Mercy to a ſinking People; and 'tis our Duty
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51432:115"/> to make this Bleſſing known all the World over (if poſſible) for the advancing his Glory. To ſay this Deliverance is paſt long ſince, is no excuſe for our not remembring it, ſince no Time muſt obliterate the Memory of ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal a Benefit, eſpecially when thoſe of this Age, owe all the Comforts they have under Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and the eſtabliſhed Church, to this happy Reſtauration. I am ſure if we be not very thankful for this Mercy, we deſerve never more to have our Prayers heard, if we fall into the like diſtreſs; nor can I ſee how we can, with any tolerable Modeſty, preſume to make the following Requeſts for future Safety, till we have owned what we have already received: Our Gratitude makes way for the ſucceeding Requeſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So we moſt humbly beſeech thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, &amp;c.]</hi> As we derive not our Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from our own Policy or Power, ſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope to ſecure it without the continuance of his favourable Providence. A flouriſhing Church will not fail of many Enemies, nor can a happy Government want many Fees. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Malice, Pride and Faction, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ambition, will blow up many, and make them reſtleſs and impatient for a Change, although it be extreamly for the worſe. Wherefore when ſuch Birds of Prey hover about us, we had need pray heartily to God to cover us under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his Wings<note n="(m)" place="margin">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51432:115"/> then we are ſure our Enemies cannot hurt us. 'Tis evident that no ſuch dire Calamity can befall us again, till our Sins have provoked our Defence to depart from us; in that caſe alone we are naked and expoſed: Wherefore while we pray for this conſtant Defence of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, while our Horror at that which we and our Fathers ſuffered under that Tyranny makes us zealous in ſupplicating the like may never befall us, let us take particular care, that our grievous Sins do not give our mighty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector juſt occaſion to deſert us, for then alas! none knows what Miſeries we may fall into.</p>

                  </note>; and this is the Judgment by which God reſolves to chaſtiſe it. As for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, neceſſity only makes it tolerable where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is eſtabliſhed. But it is ſo contrary to the Conſtitution and Genius of this Nation, where our Nobility and Gentry are ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and our People are ſo averſe to be ruled by their Fellow-ſubjects, that nothing can be more odious to our Engliſh Minds, nor could the moſt refined Politicks ever force it long upon us, or ſettle it among us: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent ſuch ruining Conteſts for the future, we pray Almighty God long to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the whole Royal Family, and that we
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51432:117"/> may both long enjoy the preſent King, and never want a Succeſſor of that illuſtrious Houſe, which hath already furniſhed us with ſo many good Princes.</p>

But after the experience of twelve woful Years, and as many new Projects of various forms of Government, if there be ſtill any Republicans, who reſolve to make new Attempts, to get the Power into their Hands, among which their own are intended to be the principal; theſe we look upon as deſperate and incurable, their Malice like that of the bloody <hi>Caſſius,</hi> is ſo implacable to Kings, that they mortally hate the very Name<note n="(u)" place="margin">Oderat tacitè Principatum, nec ferre poterat imperatorium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Vulcat. vit.

Such Men we utterly deſpair of, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them up to Heaven to puniſh them, with the like ſhame and confuſion that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took their Party at this happy Reſtauration. And if ever they do attempt to follow their Steps, probably they will come to the ſame Infamous End. None pretended to greater Politicks than they, yet none were more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hated and deſpiſed when they were
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51432:117"/> catcht in their own Snares; no Men ever fell with leſs Pity, even with the Populace which they had ever courted and cajoled. For the ill ſucceſs of all their Attempts hath given this Nation reaſon to wiſh, that the Monarchy may laſt in this Royal Family as long as the World endures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So we that are thy People, and the Sheep of thy Paſture, &amp;c.]</hi> The Prayer ends with a Vow of laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Praiſes<note n="(w)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> LXXIX. ver. 14.</note>, and a Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology; the former being made in hopes God will hear theſe Prayers for the future: The later becauſe he hath hitherto heard them. When God ſets a Righteous Shepherd over us to rule us in his Name; and by his Authority he owns us his peculiar Flock, for that obliges us to Praiſe him for our ever, that is, ſo long as we live and enjoy the benefit of a moſt Wiſe and Gracious Government. And in hopes the Bleſſing may reach to our Poſterity, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to teach our Children what a mighty Bleſſing a good King is to them and all that proceed from them. So that when we are removed to Heaven, they may continue theſe acts of Praiſe on Earth, from one Generation to another. Finally, Becauſe this great Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, like all other Mercies, was obtained only by the Interceſſion of Chriſt Jeſus, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we now bleſs Almighty God through him who is our only Mediator; and to the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51432:118"/> Son for interceding; to the Father, for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to the Holy Spirit for aſſiſting us in this Requeſt; we do aſcribe all Glory our ſelves, and doubt not but the true Church will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue theſe Acts of Praiſe from Age to Age, even to the Worlds end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
